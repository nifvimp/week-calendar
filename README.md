## Elevator Pitch
Take a look at the night agenda, the useful agenda that helps Computer Science coders keep track of goals. With the
agenda, users have the abilities to open multiple tabs to represent different weeks, create task and events and assign
completion or time duration status to them. It also comes with a list on both sides one to keep track of the number of
task and events on the left and the other to show completed or uncompleted tasks on the right to make sure you are on
track. Set an event for the wrong day or need to change something about it? No worry all you have to do is click on the
event, and you can change its properties, plus you can save or load different bujo files for different weeks. Even more
within so go ahead and give it a download to keep track of your coding tasks in a nice, convenient planner!
